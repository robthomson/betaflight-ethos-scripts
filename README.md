This is a full ethos port of the betaflight lua's to ethos.  All core functions work as expected.

Fully supported is:

- FPORT
- S.PORT
- ELRS
- CROSSFIRE

Development of this tool is not going further than its current state.  Any further efforts will be occuring on the GUI ethos version which is destined to be far superior.
